Hi,<br /><br />
You have just paid out a referrer reward in the amount of {REWARD} credits, and a customer rebate in the amount of {REBATE} credits from your{site_name} account. This brings your remaining balance to {BALANCE} credits.<br /><br />
The recipients of these Credits will not be able to redeem their money until you purchase additional Credits.<br /><br />
Your existing campaigns have been deactivated. No new offers will be made to new customers and customers trying to click on existing referrals will be informed that you are no longer honoring these referrals. All inquiries from customers about prior offers will be sent directly to you.<br /><br />
To continue your referral campaign, please <a href="{PageURL}Site/Merchant/Credits">add Credits to your account</a>.<br /><br />
To avoid this issue in the future, please <a href="{PageURL}Site/Merchant/AutoCardDetails">turn on auto replenish</a>.
